The document is divided in three main sections:

### Getting Started
It provides a quick overview of the website and its components. 
The **Framework** section explains the different components or frameworks used to create these pages.
The **Web Structure** section describes the three components that form the website:
* **Header** - it contains the navigation part of the website, with menus, submenus, logo and icons.

* **Pages** - are the holders of information
  * Containers - are wrappers that can hold one or more `modules`
    * Modules - are the structure that hold the content. These `modules` can represent simple content type like: `text`, `image`, `text-image`, `tables`, `empty-line`, `blog-card`, etc or even other more complex types like `modules` inside of `modules`.
* **Footer** - at the bottom of each page the footer contains the reference to social media icons and copyright statement.

The **Menus** section describes how to add `menus` and `submenus` to the navigation or header pannel.

The **Modules** section describes the different types of `modules` and content types.

Finally, the **How to ... Example** section, provides an example on how to add a menu for the [TestFests](https://lwm2m.openmobilealliance.org/testfests/) content.
